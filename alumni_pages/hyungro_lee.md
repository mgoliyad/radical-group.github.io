Hyungro is an Research Associate at Rutgers University. Before moving
to Rutgers, he was PhD candidate in Computer Science from the Indiana
University Bloomington under the supervision of Geoffrey Charles Fox.

His doctoral research focused on managing software environment by automated
infrastructure provisioning and containerization on cloud computing and HPC
systems.

Hyungro is interested in developing distributed server tools with efficient
resource scheduling and improving scientific application management with
bioinformatics workflow systems. He also works on system performance
monitoring, reproducible application deployment on cloud computing.

Currently, his research activities include building cyberinfrastructure for
high-performance image analysis as part of SPIDAL and ICEBERG projects. His
contribution to software development would involve RADICAL-Cybertools and the
building block approach as well as streaming systems.
