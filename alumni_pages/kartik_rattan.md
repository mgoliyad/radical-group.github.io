I am a second year Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey. My areas of interest include High performance computing, Machine learning, and Statistical Analysis. Please visit my homepage for details of my work: https://sites.google.com/view/kartikrattan/

When I am not in Radical Lab, I like to play soccer, eat good food, and read. 

I joined Radical Lab in August 2019.
