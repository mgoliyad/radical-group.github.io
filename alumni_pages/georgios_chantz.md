I am pursuing my PhD at RADICAL Lab with Professor Shantenu Jha as my advisor. Prior to joining Rutgers, I was an undergraduate student in Greece at the National Technical University of Athens. My main interests are Distributed Systems, High Performance Computing and Data Science. In my free time, I like playing soccer and traveling.
