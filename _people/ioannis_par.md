I a research software engineer with RADICAL lab. I am a develeoper of RADICAL-EnTK
and maintainer of RADICAL-Cybertools. Before joining the lab as a software engineer,
I did my PhD under the supervision of Dr. Shantenu Jha and Dr. Matteo Turilli.

My research focused on providing data-intensive capabilities on HPC for
analyzing data from Scientific simulations, through abstractions, architectures
and middleware. My research interests include High Performance Computing, Task
Parallel Applications and Architectures, Distributed System Communication
Protocols, and Distributed Data Abstractions.

Before my PhD studies, I acquired an engineering diploma (5-year studies) in
[Computer Engineering and Informatics](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en), and a
Master of Science in Integrated Hardware and Software Systems. I also worked
for three and a half years as an IC Design Engineer at Analogies SA, an IP
Semiconductor Company in Greece.
