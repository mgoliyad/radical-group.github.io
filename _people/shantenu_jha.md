Shantenu is a Professor of Computer Engineering at Rutgers University 
and the Chair of the Department (Center) for Data Driven Discovery
at Brookhaven National Laboratory. He was appointed a Rutgers Chancellor’s
Scholar in 2015. He has held visiting positions at the University of Edinburgh
and UCL.

Shantenu's research interests are at the intersection of high-performance
distributed computing and computational & data-driven science. He is the PI of
RADICAL Lab and the lead investigator of RADICAL-Cybertools project which are
a suite of middleware building blocks used to support large-scale science and
engineering applications. He is proud to play a part in the upcoming
revolution at the interface of computing and health-science — global health
and “personalized” medicine. He collaborates extensively with scientists from
multiple domains -- including but not limited to Molecular Sciences, Earth
Sciences and High-Energy Physics.

Shantenu was the recipient of the inaugural Chancellor's Excellence in
Research (2016) for his cyberinfrastructure contributions to computational
science. He was also awarded a Rutgers Board of Trustees Fellowship for
Scholarly Excellence (2014). He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award (2013)
and several best paper prizes at SC'xy and ISC'xy. His current research has
been funded by multiple NSF awards and US Department of Energy (DoE); his work
has also been funded by US National Institute for Health (NIH), and the UK
EPSRC.

Jha seeks fearless and revolutionary young minds to join the RADICAL
(thinking) group! Away from work, he tries middle-distance running and biking,
tends to be an economics-junky, enjoys reading and writing random musings and
tries to use his copious amounts of free time with a conscience.
