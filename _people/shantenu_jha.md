Shantenu is a Professor of Computer Engineering at Rutgers University 
and the Chair of the Department (Center) for Data Driven Discovery
at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

Shantenu's research interests are at the intersection of high-performance
distributed computing and computational & data-driven science. He is the PI of
RADICAL Lab and the lead investigator of RADICAL-Cybertools project which are
a suite of middleware building blocks used to support large-scale science and
engineering applications. He is proud to play a part in the upcoming
revolution at the interface of computing and health-science — global health
and “personalized” medicine. He collaborates extensively with scientists from
multiple domains -- including but not limited to Molecular Sciences, Earth
Sciences and High-Energy Physics.

Shantenu is a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award (2013), the Special Gordon Bell Award (2020) and 
several other prizes at SC'xy and ISC’xy. He lead the team that was awarded the IEEE SCALE 2018.  
Shantenu was the recipient of the inaugural Chancellor's Excellence in
Research (2016) for his cyberinfrastructure contributions to computational
science. He was also awarded a Rutgers Board of Trustees Fellowship for
Scholarly Excellence (2014) and appointed a Rutgers Chancellor’s Scholar in 2015.

Jha seeks fearless and revolutionary young minds to join the RADICAL
(thinking) group! Away from work, he tries middle-distance running and biking,
tends to be an economics-junky, enjoys reading and writing random musings and
tries to use his copious amounts of free time with a conscience.
