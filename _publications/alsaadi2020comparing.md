abstract: "Very High Resolution satellite and aerial imagery are used to 
monitor and conduct large scale surveys of ecological systems. Convolutional
Neural Networks have successfully been employed to analyze such imagery to 
detect large animals and salient features. As the datasets increase in volume
and number of images, utilizing High Performance Computing resources becomes
necessary. In this paper, we investigate three task-parallel, data-driven workflow
designs to support imagery analysis pipelines with heterogeneous tasks on HPC.
We analyze the capabilities of each design when processing datasets from two use 
cases for a total of 4,672 satellite and aerial images, and 8.35 TB of data.
We experimentally model the execution time of the tasks of the image processing pipelines.
We perform experiments to characterize the resource utilization, total time to
completion, and overheads of each design. Based on the model, overhead and
utilization analysis, we show which design is best suited to scientific pipelines
with similar characteristics."
