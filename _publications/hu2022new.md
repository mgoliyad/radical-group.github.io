abstract: "This new dataset is an ensemble of solar photovoltaic energy production simulations over the continental US. The simulations are carried out in three steps. First, a weather forecast system is used for the predictions of incoming insolation; then, forecast ensembles with 21 members are generated using the Analog Ensemble technique; finally, each ensemble member is used to simulate 13 different solar panels. In total, there are 21*13=273 simulated scenarios. Simulations are carried out for the entire year 2019, with a temporal resolution of one hour, and a spatial resolution of 12 km. The data provide a high spatio-temporal analysis of the power production under different weather and engineering scenarios. The size of the entire dataset is about 1 TB but can be openly accessed by days and scenarios. Details on how to access and use such a dataset are provided in this article."
